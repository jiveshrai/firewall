# 🔥 Real-Time Packet Filtering Firewall using Python, Scapy, and NetfilterQueue

A lightweight, real-time firewall developed in Python for dynamic packet filtering and inline inspection. Built for cybersecurity education and network defense labs, this firewall intercepts and filters packets based on custom rules for IPs and ports.

## 🧠 Key Features

- ✅ Intercepts live network traffic using NetfilterQueue
- 🔍 Inspects IP, TCP, and UDP packets with Scapy
- 🚫 Blocks traffic from blacklisted IPs or forbidden ports
- 📜 Logs all blocked packets with timestamps
- 🧪 Designed to simulate and defend against attacks in a GNS3 lab
